    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crispy smashed potatoes are delicious, golden brown, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and these have
        an extra crispy layer of broiled Parmesan cheese on top.
        There are a few extra steps involved, but they are absolutely worth the effort.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pounds (1 1/2 - to 2-inch) red skinned potatoes (12 to 16 small potatoes)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>3 ounces Parmesan cheese, finely shredded (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh italian parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Direction</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook potatoes: Bring a pot of water to the boil, add 1 tbsp salt.
            Cook potatoes until soft - small ones should take around 20 to 25 minutes,
            medium ones might take 30 minutes. It's ok if the skin splits.
            Alternatively, steam or microwave them.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan).</li>
        <li>Steam dry: Drain the potatoes and let them dry in the colander
            for 5 minutes or so.
        </li>
        <li> Smash! Place on the tray then use a large fork or potato masher to squish them, keeping them in one piece.
            Thin = crisper. Thicker = fluffier insides. (Both good!) More nubbly surface = better crunch!
        </li>
        <li>Steam dry again: Leave on the tray to steam dry for 5 minutes or so - makes them crispier!
        </li>
        <li>Drizzle: Drizzle with butter, then olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Bake: Bake for 45 minutes (small potatoes) to 55 minutes (medium) or until deep golden and crispy. Do not
            flip!
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot, sprinkled with parsley if desired.</li>

    </ol>
