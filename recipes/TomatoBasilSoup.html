            <li>Roast the Tomatoes</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Get ready. Preheat your oven to 450°F.</li>
                <li>Slice 3 pounds of Roma tomatoes in half and add to a large mixing bowl. Peel 2 medium carrots,
                    coarsely chop, and add them to the bowl. Add a generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a
                    pinch salt and pepper and toss to coat.
                    Transfer to a large baking sheet and spread well in one layer. </li>
                <li>Prep the carrots and tomatoes.</li>
                <li>Roast the carrots and tomatoes. When the oven is at 450°F, add the carrots and tomatoes and roast
                    until the tomatoes have deflated and began to char at the edges, about 30 minutes. Set aside for
                    about 10 minutes to cool.</li>

            <li>Finnish, Simmer, and Serve</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sauté the onions and garlic. In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil over
                    medium-high. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the onions and cook, stirring, until softened,
                    about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook briefly until golden, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add the tomatoes and reduce. Pour the roasted tomato mixture into the pot with the onions. Stir in 1
                    cup of canned crushed tomatoes, the basil, 3-4 fresh thyme sprigs, 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, ½
                    teaspoon each of paprika and cumin. Stir in 2 ½ cups of water and season with salt and pepper. Bring
                    to a boil, then lower the heat and cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar to allow some steam to
                    escape. Let simmer for about 20 minutes or so.</li>
                <li>Finish and serve. Remove the thyme springs and transfer the soup to serving bowls. If you like, add
                    top each serving with a squeeze of fresh lime and a generous drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.
                    Optionally, serve with your grilled bread, grilled cheese, or crusty bread on the side. Enjoy!</li>
